## Concepts

### Code Splitting

> Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven't reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you've avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.

### Tree Shaking

> Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript context for dead-code elimination. It relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax, i.e. import and export. The name and concept have been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup.
